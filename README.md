## JSort

JSort is a computer program that sorts Intager Arrays with two different methods BubbleSort and SelectionSort, both programs will sort the array.

## BubbleSort

Bubble sort will look at two numbers in the array that are beside each other, and swap them if the second is larger, then it will move one spot over in the array, and do the samething, until the array is done, then repeat until the array is fully sorted.

## SelectionSort
Selection sort creates two arrays, a sorted and un sorted array, then proceeds to fin the minimum element and place it into the sorted array. repeating untill the array is fully sorted.
